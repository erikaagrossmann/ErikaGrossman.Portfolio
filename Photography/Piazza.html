		<p class="d-flex fs-4 des">  I unfortunately did not get the privilege to live at Piazza Indipendenza.
			I was placed by housing on campus, and now only go to the Piazza when I am visiting a friend who does live there. 
			I would not say this place is my home by any means, but I am well acquainted with it. I see it quite often on weekend mornings when I am meeting my friends before we spend the day in the city or weekend nights when I am walking with them back to their dorms after a night out.
			But for this project I got the opportunity to sit in the Piazza as my final destination. On a random weekday afternoon, I bused down from campus to Piazza Indipendenza, and got to wander and observe the regular activities that take place there on a daily basis.<br/>
		   I sat and observed from a far, and stood up to pass by when I wanted a closer look. What stood out to me most while I was here was what people carried- or didnâ€™t carry as they passed through this place to their final destination. <br/>
		   I stayed a far distance away from most of my subjects, not wanting to disturb them in their peace or hustle through the Piazza. I start with a man, minding his own business, listening to music on a bench and end with a bench, but empty. While in the middle of this man being there and leaving, life is going on all around him.
