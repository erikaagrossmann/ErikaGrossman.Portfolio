		It's Sunday and there’s classes tomorrow. Work piles up over the weekend after a trip to Berlin. You are feeling lazy and tired, 
		so you decide it’s best to get out of the house to get some work done. You take a stroll and find a bookstore that has a 
		small cafe counter and seating in the back.<br/>
		You take a seat, get comfy, and open your laptop to start working. You are able to finish some 
		work but start drifting. You notice the man in front of you reading on a kindle but your lock on 
		his coffee cup. What is he reading? What is he drinking? Maybe it’s smart to get a coffee to wake
		 yourself up and focus a bit more. You walk over to the counter and order an iced latte. 
		 Definitely gives away that you are american- as the piles of empty hot drink mugs sit in front 
		 of you while you wait. <br/>
		You walk back to your seat and start sipping. You look to the left and see a couple. Quietly talking, enjoying 
		their drinks and each other's company. You wonder what they are talking about, what they did this weekend, how 
		far into their relationship they are. You snap back to your computer, knowing you need to focus. Maybe it wasn’t 
		the smartest idea to come to a coffee shop as a people watcher when you need to get work done. You get some more work done,
		 reading book snippets and completing worksheets. <br/>
		You drift off once again, and zone out. This time not on the people that surround you, just into the nothingness of space beside 
		you. Could you use a new book? New bag? New sweater? Not really, but shopping is always fun for you. You look at your latte 
		and realize somehow while zoning you must have finished it. Maybe you should’ve just locked yourself in your room to do your work so you 
		wouldn’t have gotten so distracted. You got some work done in the cozy environment the bookstore brought, but not as much as you could’ve. Would life be better as 
		someone whose focus belongs solely to them no matter the location? Or would it just be more dull?
