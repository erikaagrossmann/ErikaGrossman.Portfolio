<p class="d-flex fs-2 name"> Multimedia Transformation Piece</p>
<p class="d-flex fs-4 des"> Created Spring 2022</p>
<p class="d-flex fs-4 des"> This project shows the transformation of me in my senior year of 
	high school, through mulitmedia art techniques. The top piece represents how I had felt
in the beginning of my senior year. I was lost and confused and focused my piece on just that.
I used graphite pencil and sharpie to draw the interior of my car, watercolor to create the 
gloomy and rainy weather seen in the windshield, and procreate to draw the purple versions of me in 
the drivers seat and on the dashboard as well as the brain and looming swirls. <br>
The bottom piece represents how I felt as I ended my senior year. I had found myself, happiness, and 
freedom as I had finally let go to fully and truly be myself. I used colored pencil to draw the car
I am poping out of, graphite pencil to draw the 3D lamp post shining an oil pastel rainbow on me,
watercolor for the hilly background and sunset, and procreate to create the purple me and swirls.  </p>
